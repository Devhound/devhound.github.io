  <h4><strong>Policies</strong></h4>


  <p>The philosophy of Recreational Sports dictates that no single activity, special event, and/or sport should dominate the use of the Student
    Recreation Center (SRC). Recreational Sports upholds the University Code of Student Conduct.</p>

<p>Recreational Sports strives to conduct all activities in the most prudent manner possible; however, due to the inherent risk of injury in any activity, it is the responsibility of each participant to be aware that there are assumed risks involved in participation. All participants are strongly urged to have a yearly medical examination and to carry medical insurance coverage. Texas Tech University and its staff are not responsible for injuries including death. Participation in Recreational Sports facilities or programming is voluntary.</p>

<p>Rules and policies are posted and published for distribution to our patrons. All policies are established by the Department of Recreational
  Sports and Texas Tech University. The authority to enforce these policies is vested in Recreational Sports staff and the administrative personnel
  responsible for these programs. Student employees do not have the option to overlook, change, or bend rules; their task is to conduct business
  according to set policies. Students in violation of Recreational Sports policies and/or procedures may have disciplinary action taken per the
  guidelines of the Texas Tech University Handbook and the Texas Tech University Code of Student Conduct.</p>


<strong><h4>Conduct in the Student Recreation Center</h4></strong>

<p>All participants are expected to play according to the rules of the Recreational Sports Department and Texas Tech University Regulations.
  Recreational Sports staff reserves the right to penalize individuals or teams for violation of these rules. Participants who choose to follow
  unsportsmanlike practices, whether directed toward an opponent or staff member may be ejected from that contest and/or asked to leave the facility.
  Any Recreational Sports staff member reserves the right to eject a patron from the facility. Examples of unsportsmanlike conduct which may result in
  ejection and/or suspension include verbal abuse, excessive technical fouls, flagrant actions toward an opponent, flagrant actions toward an official
  or staff member, and fighting or inciting a fight. Alcohol and/or drug use or possession is a direct violation of Rec Sports policies and the Code of
  Student Conduct (Section B, part 3 & 4). Rec Sports reserves the right to refuse participation to any player that is suspected of being under the
  influence of alcohol and/or drugs.</p>

<p>Further, any participant who engages in unsportsmanlike practices or is under the influence of alcohol/drugs shall have their case reviewed by
  Recreational Sports professional staff to determine penalties assessed and may then have their case referred to the Office of Student Conduct for
  further action.</p>
